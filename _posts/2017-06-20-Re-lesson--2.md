    <td>I looked up a python cheatsheet online to try and understand more commands and functions. I also asked people who I knew were good at coding for a bit of help but I tried not to be reliant on them. I tried to use Lucidchart as well but it didn't work very well.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I should have spent more time working on a flow diagram because after I had completed one thing I did not know what to do next. This got very slow and inefficient. Another thing that limited my learning was the fact that I only knew a select few functions.</td>
