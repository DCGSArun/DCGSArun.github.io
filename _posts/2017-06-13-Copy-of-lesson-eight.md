    <td>I used W3Schools to help me relearn all the basic commands I needed to successfully customise my blog. It was very effective and I managed to get a lot of work done. If I got stuck then I would ask owin of the people next to me if they new how to do it. I didn't have to do this very often so I didn't annoy my peers by asking them to many questions.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The one thing that limited my learning was that no matter what I did I could not manage to get my background to work. At first I thought it was the slow refresh rates. So I spent ages waiting for GitHub to refresh. But after a while I realised that it was not GitHub it was my coding so I spent the rest of the lesson trying to get it to work. But sadly to no avail.</td>
